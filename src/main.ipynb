    "## Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite a lot of creeping Physics and Chemistry knowledge introduced in the description, this competition is more about Geometry and pattern matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis of this kernel is next:\n",
    "1. If we have two similar sets of atoms with the same distances between them and the same types - the scalar coupling constant should be very close.\n",
    "2. More closest atoms to the pair of atoms under prediction have higher influence on scalar coupling constant then those with higher distance\n",
    "\n",
    "So, basically, this problem could be dealt with some kind of K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm or any tree-based - e.g. LightGBM, in case we can find some representation which would describe similar configurations with similar feature sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each atom is described with 3 cartesian coordinates. This representation is not stable. Each coupling pair is located in a different point in space and two similar coupling sets would have very different X,Y,Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, instead of using coordinates let's consider next system:\n",
    "1. Take each pair of atoms as two first core atoms\n",
    "2. Calculate the center between the pair\n",
    "3. Find all n-nearest atoms to the center (excluding first two atoms)\n",
    "4. Take two closest atoms from step 3 - they will be 3rd and 4th core atoms\n",
    "5. Calculate the distances from 4 core atoms to the rest of the atoms and to the core atoms as well\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this representation each atom position can be described by 4 distances from the core atoms. This representation is stable to rotation and translation. And it's suitable for pattern-matching. So, we can take a sequence of atoms, describe each by 4 distances + atom type(H,O,etc) and looking up for the same pattern we can find similar configurations and detect scalar coupling constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I used LightGBM, because sklearn KNN can't deal with the amount of data. My blind guess is that hand-crafted KNN can outperform LightGBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's code the solution!"
